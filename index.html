        <p>
          Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni, is one of the
          greatest cricketers and captains in the history of Indian cricket. He
          is known for his incredible leadership, calm demeanor, and
          match-winning performances. An attacking right-handed middle-order
          batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the
          greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day
          International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and
          played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.
